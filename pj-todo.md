# Philip's To Do List.

## Observation implementation

* Add a single 2022 planting instance to Jenna's garden so she has a start. 

* Update data model with:
  * startType field (direct seed, greenhouse, starter) (for planting instance)
  * perennial: true (for plant)

* Add observation data
  * Encompass all types.
  * Focus on a single year to start.
  * Some should be threaded.
  * All observations should be tagged "public".
  * Need users outside of JD and JB to illustrate community involvement. 

* Add icon and popup 
* Actually need to have both "Observations" and "Notifications"
  * Illustrating this requires that Jesse's garden have the same planting as Jenna's. 

## Old Stuff

* Dynamically generate outcome star fields and values from the outcome object.
* Add a showPerennials checkbox.
* Support climate data.
