  * Gardeners: Master Gardener.

  * Chapter Seeds: Convert to table
  * Trewartha Zone data: https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/7yt1pj/trewartha_climate_types_of_washington_state_1260/

### Plans

* Create dummy section with background shading.

### Seeds

* Create dummy section with background shading.


### Workflow

* Create issues in project board.

We need to provide support for "backfilling" of the seed database by members with outcome data from prior seasons.

"Pest resilience" is an important feature of a seed.
