# Plan Section To Do

## Design thoughts

Plant database updates:
- Cultivar -> Plant
- daysToMaturity (estimated) vs. (historical)

PlantFamily database:
- lists all of the families.
- each family has a specified color
- may also have an "examples" field
- each Plant in the Plant database has a plantFamily field.

Create plants for Jenna's garden, starting at ID = plant-100.
