# Plan Section To Do

## Design thoughts

* Need a special Documentation box for explaining the plant background colors and how they related to families.

* Next step for Planting timeline.
  * Create entry for a plant:
    - plantID
    - startDate
    - transplantDate
    - harvestDate: {estimated: <date>, actual: <date>}
    - endDate
    - startGreenhouse
    - bedID
    - observations
    - outcomes (add germination)

* Add lightened colors to theme to illustrate greenhouse and harvest intervals.
* Then show file to Jenna, request edits. 
* Don't make a link when vendorURL is missing.
